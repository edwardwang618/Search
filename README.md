 Two search demos. 
 
 lucenefirst is a project which uses lucene, and a third party analyzer IKAnalyzer to analyze the files in the "searchsource" directory, build the index and do some queries. All of the CRUD operations have been tested in the project. 
 
 solrDemo1 is a project which uses solrj to do CRUD operations on the solr server.
